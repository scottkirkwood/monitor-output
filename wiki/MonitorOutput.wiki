= Introduction =

Waiting for your compile to finish or server to startup is boring. Having a program do it for you is cool!

How it works is you create a setup that searches for text in the output and when that text is detected it fires off a command.  The command can do anything including modifying the output as to make it appear different (ex. in color).

= How To Run =

The easiest way to run this in linux like systems is
{{{
myprogram --and --parameters 2>&1 | monitor-output
}}}
The 2>&1 is optional, but useful, it'll also send stderr output to monitor-output.
If you want to monitor a log file you can run 
{{{
tail -f mylog.log | monitor-output
}}}
You can also ask monitor output to run the program for you, but I find it doesn't work quite the same so I advise against it for now.  Ex.
{{{
monitor-output myprogram
}}}

You can create various events by making "plugins" which need to live in the {{{python*/site-packages/monitor-output/monitoroutput/plugins}}} directory.  Any .py file in that directory that doesn't have an underscore at the start of the name will be loaded up as plugin.
